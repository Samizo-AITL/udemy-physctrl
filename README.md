## 🎯 Purpose

This course and repository focus on **control as a design tool**, not just tuning.

- Start from **physical and V–I models**
- Design **PID controllers** based on dynamics
- Extend to **FSM-supervised control**
- Understand how control compensates **nonlinearity, saturation, and variation**

This approach naturally connects **physics, devices, and control**.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Control is not isolated mathematics  
- **Physical models define control structure**
- V–I characteristics are treated as **control objects**
- FSM handles **mode transitions and constraints**

This philosophy is part of the broader **Samizo-AITL** framework.
